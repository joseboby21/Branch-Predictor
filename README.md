# Branch-Predictor
This is my homework in Computer Architecture Course.

BranchPredictor.py is a functional simulation of one level branch predictor, two-level global branch predictor, two-level Gshare branch predictor and two-level Local Branch Predictor. All these branch predictors are using a two-bit saturating counter in their pattern history table.
Usage: python3 BranchPredictor.py

nbitBranchPredictor is a functional simulation of two-level Gshare branch predictor and two-level local branch predictor, where the number of bits in the saturating counter could be varied according to the input given.
Usage: python3 nbitBranchPredictor.py

Hybrid.py is a functional simulation of tournament branch predictor
Usage: python3 hybrid.py

The trace file is in branch-trace-gcc.zip
